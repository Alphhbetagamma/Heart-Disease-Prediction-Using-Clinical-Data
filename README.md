# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Clinical-Data
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical parameters. The model is trained on the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, one of the most widely used benchmark datasets for cardiovascular research.

The system takes patient clinical attributes as input and outputs a binary prediction:

0 → No Heart Disease

1 → Presence of Heart Disease

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can assist in early detection of cardiovascular conditions using structured medical data.

#DATASET

This project uses the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset Features (Input Parameters)

The dataset contains 13 key clinical features:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type (cp)

Resting blood pressure (trestbps)

Serum cholesterol (chol)

Fasting blood sugar (fbs)

Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)

Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)

Exercise induced angina (exang)

ST depression (oldpeak)

Slope of peak exercise ST segment (slope)

Number of major vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

Target Variable (Output)

0 → No heart disease

1 → Heart disease present

#WORKFLOW

1) Load and preprocess dataset

2) Split data into training and testing sets

3) Train classification model

4) Evaluate model performance

5) Generate binary prediction (0 or 1)
